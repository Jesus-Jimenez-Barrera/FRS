# Face_Recognition
This repository has been created for the development of a facial recognition application, it continues to be constantly developed and improved.

To standardize the updates and way of working, we will work with the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 versioning system in which the scheme is as follows:
  
  1. alpha: For early development versions that are not stable.
  2. beta: For more stable pre-release versions that are close to the final release.
  3. rc (release candidate): For final release candidate versions that are about to be published.
