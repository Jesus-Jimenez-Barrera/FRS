## Description 
This repository has been created for the development of a facial recognition application, it continues to be constantly developed and improved.

## Version control
To standardize the updates and way of working, we will work with the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 versioning system in which the scheme is as follows:
  
  1. Pre_alpha (PreA): Activities performed during the software project before formal testing
  2. Alpha (A): For early development versions that are not stable.
  3. Beta (B): For more stable pre-release versions that are close to the final release.
  4. Release candidate (RC): For final release candidate versions that are about to be published.

  example: 
  PreA 0.0.1.0
